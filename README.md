# vim-latex aka latex-suite

**DO NOT USE**

This is a **mangled** version of [vim-latex](https://github.com/vim-latex/vim-latex) (aka LaTeX Suite). I am currently trying to migrate to a lighter version, possibly [vimtex](https://github.com/lervag/vimtex). Though `vim-latex` was great when I started, I have since outsourced most of its functionality to other vim plugins.
